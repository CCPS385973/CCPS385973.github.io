    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am working toward to being more social, as I want to specialize in a job that requires talking to many people a day. 
      I aspire to get a good job that I find myself thriving in and well adapted for, such as a job in the medical field that 
      I, personally, can work well in. Though, I am not fully responsible for my interest in the medical field, my mother, 
      who works in the medical field has influenced me greatly in my career choice, and my research on medical jobs from 
      prior projects and sudden interest. To help work toward these goals, I have done research on such jobs I believe 
      I can thrive in and in my current job I've been practicing talking to customers calmly, and comfortably, as 
      I know the medical field requires you to talk to people in a calm matter especially during an emergency,which I feel is important to 
      practice and achieve. Though, it is not easy to achieve this goals. You need to have motivation to work hard even if you're not motivated
      or unable to gain energy.As it is well aware, in the medical field you work with other people consistently, so therefore you need to know
      how to effectively communicate to other people and have a sense of  unity in the workplace. I hope to accomplish the ability to motivate myself
      and others even when I feel as if I can't. I also hope to acquire more knowledge on medical qualities, education, and careers, so I do not go 
      into a situation blind. I especially want to speak calmly to higher authority, professionally and easily in the near future. I want to be known 
      for my loyalty to people, friends, and work, as I have been mostloyal to those specific things and strive to stayloyal for as long as possible. 
      I especially want to be most known for my problem solving skills I have deeply worked on and the work I put into being the person I am today.</p>
